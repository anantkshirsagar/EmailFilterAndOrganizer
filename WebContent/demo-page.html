This is a demo-page.html page and all of your pages are like this page
Here we have used angular js to add external .html files
From ng-app directive our angular js project starts
We are trying to club all libraries in one .html called as load-libs.html
So you have to design page in the body section
And don't use angularjs in project other than only include html pages.
All of the services, server calls are using ajax / servlet.

We are using w3-css,
